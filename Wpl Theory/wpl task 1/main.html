           As a web developer, I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly
            websites and web applications using modern technologies. My core skills include HTML,
             CSS,  and frameworks . I am experienced with backend development using Node.js and Express,
              and I work with databases such as MySQL. I follow best practices in coding, version control (Git),
              
              and performance optimization to deliver high-quality, maintainable solutions. I'm also comfortable with deployment and DevOps tools, 
              ensuring smooth delivery from development to production.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p class="paralignlist">
I have worked on several full-stack projects in collaboration with back-end developers, where I was primarily responsible for the front-end architecture, UI development, and seamless API integration. One of the key projects I developed was a Task Management Web App, where I built an intuitive and responsive interface using React and Tailwind CSS. The app allowed users to create, update, and organize tasks with real-time status updates, utilizing a RESTful API built in Node.js and MongoDB. I also contributed to an E-commerce platform, where I implemented features like dynamic product listings, cart functionality, and checkout flow, while integrating payment gateways like Stripe.

        <p class="paralignlist">
           I specialize in crafting modern, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces using technologies like React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
           
           and Tailwind CSS. I provide end-to-end front-end development services, including UI/UX implementation, pixel-perfect design integration
             from tools like Figma or Adobe XD, responsive layout development, component-based architecture,
              and performance optimization. I also 
             
        focus on integrating RESTful and GraphQL APIs provided by back-end teams, ensuring smooth data flow and dynamic content rendering. My services include building dashboards, SPAs (Single Page Applications), real-time web apps, and e-commerce front-ends, as well as handling form validation, error handling, and cross-browser compatibility.

    <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="paralignlist">
          I began my journey into web development with a curiosity about how websites work and quickly discovered a passion for coding and problem-solving. As a self-motivated learner, I enjoy building small projects that challenge me and help me apply what I am learned. My 
          
          goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of working on both the front and back end of web applications. I am currently focused
            
          on building a strong foundation in frontend development, and I am open to internships, collaborations, and opportunities that allow me 
          
          to gain real-world experience and grow in the tech industry
